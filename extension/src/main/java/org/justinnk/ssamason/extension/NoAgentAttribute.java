/**
 * Signal to a dependency-based SSA that the annotated field is not to be tracked as an attribute of
 * the owning agent. This is useful when using fields that are not final, but effectively constant,
 * i.e. do not change during the simulation. Such fields may be useful when they must be initialised
 * in the constructor. HANDLE WITH CARE, as this might break dependency-based SSAs.
