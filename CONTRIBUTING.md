### Set Up Pre-Commit

1. Install `pre-commit`, see [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
   - This can also be done through your package manager, e.g. `sudo pacman -S python-pre-commit`
2. Run `pre-commit install` in the repository root
3. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` in the repository root

### IDE

It is easiest working with an IDE like [Eclipse]() or [Intellij]().
If you are using an IDE, import this project as a maven project. Most IDEs include support either natively or through a
plugin (usually called `maven...`) you have to install.
Although recommended, using an IDE is not required.

### Build the Project

To build the project, run `maven clean compile`.
